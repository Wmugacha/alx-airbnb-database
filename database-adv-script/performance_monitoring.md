### **Using `SHOW PROFILE` (MySQL) or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (PostgreSQL) to Monitor Query Performance**

#### **Purpose**

* Monitor how long different stages of a query take (parsing, planning, execution).
* Identify **slow queries** that affect application performance.

---

### **Key Tools**

* **MySQL**:

  * `SHOW PROFILE` â€“ Breaks down query time (e.g., sending data, waiting for lock).
  * `SHOW PROFILES` â€“ Lists recent queries with execution time.

* **PostgreSQL**:

  * `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` â€“ Provides detailed query plan with actual run times and row counts.
  * `pg_stat_statements` â€“ Tracks query stats system-wide.

### **What to Look For (Common Bottlenecks)**

* **Sequential scans** on large tables â†’ may suggest missing indexes.
* **Nested loop joins** on large data sets â†’ may benefit from `Hash Join` or `Merge Join`.
* **High execution time** in stages like "Join Filter", "Sort", or "Aggregate".
* **Table scans** â†’ possibly due to poor filtering or lack of proper WHERE clause conditions.

---

### **Fixes to Consider**

* **Create indexes** on columns frequently used in `JOIN`, `WHERE`, or `ORDER BY`.
* **Rewrite queries** to reduce data volume early (e.g., use subqueries or CTEs).
* **Partition large tables** (e.g., by date) to improve lookup performance.
* **Normalize or denormalize** schema depending on access patterns.
* **Use `LIMIT`** when full result set isn't needed.

### ðŸš€ **Why It Matters**

* Speeds up your application
* Saves server resources
* Makes your system scale better with more data and users
